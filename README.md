# challenge-card-game-becode


This is a card game project assignment for the implamantation of the course material for Object Oriented Programming in Python during my AI/Data Science education at BeCode.

I have started with creating a repository in GitHub with the required files.
Then I have moved to my text editor Visual Studio Code to start coding in Python language.
I have created different classes. These were the following:
-Symbol
-Card
-Player
-Deck
-Board
